        During set up, mobile data for Android (or cellular, for iOS) should be switched off. You can do this from your
        device settings. You should remain connected to Wi-Fi. This is to prevent switching between networks, which may
        cause setup to fail. After setup, feel free to turn mobile data back on.

        Of course, please make sure your home Wi-Fi details are correct. If your home Wi-Fi doesn’t show up in the list
